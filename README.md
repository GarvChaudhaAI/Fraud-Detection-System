# Fraud-Detection-System
## Overview
This repository contains a google colab file which implements several ML algorithms for building a fraud detection system. It uses the credit card fraud detection dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
### Task 1
Downloading and importing the dataset. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE and using feature engineering techniques to improve model performace.
### Task 2 
Implementing 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forests
3. Neural Networks
4. Support Vector Machines
5. XGBoost
6. LightGBM
### Task 3
Evaluting different model performance on test data using appropriate metrics like precision-recall curve and ROC AUC score.
